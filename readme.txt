1. All the coding and changes are done in "maze.cpp" and "maze.h". "maze.cpp" contains two required designs, which are "Prim" and "Design on your own" . When running the maze.exe, you will directly get two output files for two designs. 

2. For the given three test cases, the results are dumped and saved in this folder. Please refer to "mst_result_init.txt",
 "mst_result_tb2.txt",
"mst_result_tb2.txt",
"routing_result_init.txt",
"routing_result_tb1.txt",
"routing_result_tb2.txt",
if there is any need.

Thank you for this quarter!

Have a good spring break!
